Technology Wilts in the Heat
When rolling blackouts hit parts of the San Francisco Bay Area Wednesday , the local power grid failed to keep pace with the demand for electricity during a second consecutive day of blistering heat .
Officials at the California Independent System Operator , which oversees operation of most of the state 's power system , said that Pacific Gas & Electric was cutting service to customers east and south of San Francisco on a rotating basis in an attempt to avoid more widespread blackouts .
Farther south , PG&E issued a number of requests to several Silicon Valley companies , asking them to voluntarily cut down on their power consumption .
Thursday was hot , but cooler .
The company says that it has extensive recovery plans for these kinds of situations .
Collins said that PG&E did not ask tech companies to send people home , as some news reports claimed , but only to curb their power usage .
" To go out and ask customers to curb their power use the way we did was unusual , " he said . "
We couldn’t log in to anything and caused network problems when the power came back on . "
" Those that do n't have offsite backup facilities or self-contained power go down , " said Joel Baker , a network analyst for a Bay Area Internet service provider . "

PARIS -- France 's Vivendi , its Canal Plus pay-TV unit , and Canada 's Seagram said on Tuesday they would merge in a $ 34 billion all-share deal that creates a new global media powerhouse to rival AOL-Time Warner .
The terms of the share swap are subject to a so-called " collar , " which protects against big swings in the share prices ahead of the conclusion of the deal .
The precise number of Vivendi shares to be exchanged for Seagram shares will be subject to the collar -- should Vivendi 's stock trade below $ 96.69 the swap rate will be fixed at 0.8 and should it trade above $ 124.30 the swap rate would be 0.622 .
Vivendi launched the portal with British partner Vodafone AirTouch on Monday , offering Internet access and online services to the group 's combined 80 million mobile phone users and pay TV subscribers in Europe .
Vivendi also controls France 's number two telecoms operator Cegetel , publisher Havas , film group Pathe and a stake in Web provider AOL France .
Worries center around the dilutive impact of a deal on Vivendi earnings and losses in some of Seagram 's activities .

Starting with Windows 98 , Microsoft sewed the Windows Explorer desktop and Internet Explorer browser closer , insisting customers wanted this feature .
However , with 98 Lite 2.0 , Brooks found a way to modify the Windows Registry to unhook IE from Explorer , so no file replacement was required .
" Windows ME has some features that people will say are big improvements and others will say are no good at all , so one of the things I tried to do is let people keep only the features they want , " Brooks said .

The P4 , released Monday , features what Intel said is the first completely new desktop processor design since its 1995 release of the Pentium Pro processor .
But , according to some experts , the P4 is n't very intuitive when it comes to standard office applications .
" Intel is using what they 've dubbed ' Hyper Pipelined Technology ' which allows the P4 chip to handle more processes at one time , " McCormick said . "
Frankly , from what I 'm seeing , I 'll tell my corporate clients to wait on the 1.13 GHz Pentium III , due early next year , which I really believe will produce faster speeds in basic applications than the Pentium 4 , " said McCormick .
The lack of speed increase puzzled some experts , who say the P4 's snappier system BUS , which now runs at 400 MHz -- compared to 133 MHz in top end PIII chips -- should have produced a greater speed increase across the board .
Once we have applications in place that take advantage of these new multimedia instructions , only then will you see real performance improvements , " Ponti said . "
