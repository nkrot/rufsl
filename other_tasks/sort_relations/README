Suppose you are working on prepositional phrase attachment. You have collected data -- r__VerbPhrase and r__NounPhrase_additional relations from a large amount of textual data -- and want to build XXX

More precisely, you want to analyse cases of attachment of a preposition to multiple antecedents. To make working with, probably viewing, data more confortable, you want to reorganize relations such that:
1) rVP and rNPA with the same preposition and indirect object are placed adjacent
2) within each group relations are sorted by the relation name: r__VerbPhrases go first and rNPA follow them
3) groups appear in the order in which the prepositions come in the sentence
4) all other relations are not shown
   you dont want preposition that appear only once (in the real life, you may want them, mayn't you?, -- they are nonambiguous attachments)
