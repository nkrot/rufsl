Develop a script that extracts from ESE dictionary all adjectives (JJ) that have conversion to JJR.

You should be able to run your script as follows:

	> DicTester --all | ./find_jj_with_jjr.rb

Starter script is: find_jj_with_jjr_stub.rb

Before you start coding, you may want to investigate in detail the output format of DicTester --all.

Compare the output of your script with the output of the given find_jj_with_jjr.rb
