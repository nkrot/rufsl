Develop a script that counts English words from ESE in three categories:
1) having VB and NN and JJ tags
2) having VB and NN tags but not having JJ tag
3) having VB and not having NN and JJ tags

as a source of data, use DicTester command:

   > DicTester --all --brief | ./count_vb_nn_jj.rb

Starter script: count_vb_nn_jj.rb

Before you start, carefully investigate how DicTester outputs data with --all and --brief options.

You may want to know what \b flag means in Ruby regexp, refer to:

Expected output:
VB+NN+JJ 264
VB+NN    13
VB       11
