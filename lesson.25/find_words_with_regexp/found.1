develop	A new version of the Apple Public Source License 1.2 , released on Wednesday , addresses and alters all of the primary issues that many developers had problems with ; many programmers felt that the original APSL was heavily weighted towards Apple 's benefit .
develop	Stallman cited problems that centered on Apple 's perceived lack of respect for open source developers and their work .
develop	Earlier versions of the APSL did not allow developers to modify code for their personal use -- any and all changes had to be publicly distributed .
develop	Stallman was also concerned about the APSL 's insistence that Apple be notified each and every time a developer made a change to source code .
develop	Stallman also had problems with the APSL 's termination clause , which essentially allowed Apple to revoke the APSL agreement if anyone accused a developer of copyright or patent infringement and forbid the developer from continuing to use all or some part(s) of the software .
develop	Under the terms of the new APSL , developers no longer need to distribute modifications made for personal use , are no longer required to notify Apple when code modifications are released , and the Infringement/Suspension clause has been removed ; developers are now responsible for securing all necessary rights themselves .
develop	Stallman was unavailable for immediate comment on the new version of APSL , but many developers are pleased with it .

develop	" But I feel , as do many other developers I 've spoken with and communicated with on Apple 's Darwin developers mailing list , that this is one of those once in a blue moon occurrences -- a big corporation just did something that actually makes more sense to regular people then it does to their legal team .
