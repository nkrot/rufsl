=========
[...] slowest implementation of find_words, based on array. prepare a demo
        Array#intersect
        sentence_words.each {|w| queries.include?(w)}
        queries.each {|w| sentence_words.include?(w)}
[...] continue with find_words


for code review #3 (lessons 13+)
================================
TODO: develop testcases for Syn module and handle them out as a supplement to code review 3

1) maxfreqtag
2) your own Syn module (syn.rb) that should implement the following methods
	tags   -- given a tagged string, returns all tags as an array
	words  -- given a tagged string, returns all words as an array
	untag  -- given a tagged word/sentence/relation, returns untagged word/sentence/relation as a string.
	unword -- given a tagged word/sentence, returns tag(s) as a string
	unwdc  -- given a tagged sentence/relation, collapse compound words (see slide 127 for details)
 * Hint: A relation can be distinguished from non-relations by presence of at least one \t character. The first field in the relation is always a relation name. 

3) insert_sort_to_new
4) insert_sort_in_place
5) find_all_anagrams
6) find_words
7) assign_properties
